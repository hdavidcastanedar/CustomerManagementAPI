Customer Management REST API with Clean Architecture
Description:

This project is a RESTful web API developed using Clean Architecture principles, designed for managing customer information efficiently and securely. Built with .NET and C#, this API supports fundamental operations such as querying, creating, updating, and deleting customer records in the database, providing a comprehensive solution for customer management.

Key Features:

* CRUD Operations: Allows querying, creating, updating, and deleting customer information seamlessly.
Customer Information: Manages essential customer details, including Name, DNI (National Identity Document), Address (comprising State and City), Phone, Mobile, and Email.
* In-Memory Database: Utilizes an in-memory database to store customer data, enabling rapid deployment and testing without the need for external database installations.
* Entity Framework (EF): Leverages Entity Framework for ORM, ensuring efficient data manipulation and abstracting database interactions.
* Unit Tests: Includes a suite of unit tests to verify the API's functionality and ensure the reliability and integrity of the customer data management.
* Seed Data: Automatically populates the database with test data upon startup, facilitating immediate testing and demonstration.
* Zero Installation: Designed to run out-of-the-box. Simply download the code, and you're ready to start without installing any databases or additional plugins.
